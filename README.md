# Final Project


The idea for this project came from a friend of mine who was having trouble at work.

 My firend works as a IR in a FOF company and he was really confused because their company doesn't have a system to store all the data of the fofs.
 
 They just use redundant excel tables and that is very difficult to find and maintain
 
 There are some core variables in this project: fof, fund(which belongs to a manager),project(belongs to an entrepreneur).
 
 The relationship between fof and fund is "many to many", and the link between fof and fund is called "option" in this case.
 
 Similarly, the link between fund and project is called "investment"
 
 Every user could see all the fofs but could only edit/delete the fofs which belong to himself/herself. But I believe the other databases are public and could be CRUD by all users.
 
 Users could see his/her own fofs and check and maintain them on a daily basis. It would be easy for my friend and his colleages to fulfill their works.
